Area Power 2019:
	hourly power outputs from wind energy for target areas in Japan

OPSO Power Curve:
	-main = main simulation program to optimize power curve parameters
	-grapher = used to graph power curves
	-estimator = outputs local wind farm power outputs using input parameters
	-ESTvsOBS = sums up the selected estimated local wind farm power output data and  compares it with the observed area power output data
	-error_analyzer = outputs estimated and observed power output line plots for the year

Wind Speed to CSV:
	uses WPplace location coordinate data (longitude and latitude) and outputs wind speed data from the LA data to a CSV file
