Area Power 2019:
	hourly power outputs from wind energy for target areas in Japan

OPSO Power Curve:
	-main = main simulation program to optimize power curve parameters
	-grapher = used to graph power curves
	-estimator = outputs local wind farm power outputs using input parameters
	-ESTvsOBS = uses the designated estimated local wind farm power outputs and  compares with observed area power output
	-error_analyzer = outputs estimated and observed power output line plots for the year

Wind Speed to CSV:
	outputs wind speed data to CSV
